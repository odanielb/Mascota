# Mascota
Creator: Bridget O'Daniel (odanielbri@gmail.com)

Description: A fun, interactive pet game in Python that urges the user to take care of a named pet who will get increasingly sicker as time passes by purchasing it items from the Shop. Mascota: Spanish for "pet". This was my final project for my CSC 236 Data Structures class.

Errors: Display errors upon death of pet. If Item is bought from store while it is restocking, money will be taken from the player but the item will not be received. Friendship level currently does not increase. Also, an inconvenience: the stats do not visibly change until the player moves the cursor or does another action on screen.
