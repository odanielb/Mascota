# Mascota
Creator: Bridget O'Daniel (odanielbri@gmail.com)

Description: A fun, interactive pet game in Python that urges the user to take care of a named pet who will get increasingly sicker as time passes by purchasing it items from the Shop. Mascota: Spanish for "pet". This was my final project for my CSC 236 Data Structures class.

Known errors: Display errors upon death of pet. If Item is bought from store while it is restocking, money will be taken from the player but the item will not be received.
